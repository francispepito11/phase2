- Admin access is secured by session-based authentication
- Database queries use prepared statements to prevent SQL injection

## Future Enhancements

- Mobile application client for on-the-go access
- Integration with other government information systems
- Enhanced reporting and analytics dashboard
- Client self-service portal
- Two-factor authentication for admin access
- API development for third-party integrations
- Load balancing for improved performance

## Development Roadmap
- **Q3 2025**: Email notification system implementation

- **Q1 2026**: Client self-service portal development
- **Q2 2026**: Mobile application release

## Troubleshooting
- **Database Connection Issues**: Verify credentials in `includes/db_connect.php`
